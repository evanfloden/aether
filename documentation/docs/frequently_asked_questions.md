## Will you add support for cloud provider X?
Our immediate goal is continue extending support for AWS and Azure - the most widely used cloud services - and improving Aether core features.
However, we may eventually add support for other cloud platforms.
Follow the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/kosticlab/aether) to track updates.
If you have added support for a cloud provider that you use, consider filing an issue or submitting a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/kosticlab/aether).
