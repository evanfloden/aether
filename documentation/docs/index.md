# Aether

Aether is an intuitive, easy to use, cost-effective, and scalable framework that
uses linear programming (LP) to optimally bid on and deploy combinations of
underutilized cloud computing resources. Our approach simultaneously minimizes
the cost of data analysis while maximizing efficiency and speed.
Through its optimized instance bidding, Aether is able to reduce cloud computing costs by nearly ninety percent.
Aether was developed jointly by the [Kostic](http://www.kosticlab.org) and
[Patel](http://www.chiragjpgroup.org) labs at Harvard Medical School. Source
code is available [here](https://github.com/kosticlab/aether).
