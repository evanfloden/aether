## The Name

"Cumulonimble" is a punning portmanteau of "[cumulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulus_cloud)" and "[nimble](https://www.google.com/search?q=define+nimble)", which resembles "[cumulonimbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulonimbus_cloud)".
This is fitting, as cumulus clouds and cumulonimbus clouds are low-altitude clouds, and Cumulonimble is a quick and lightweight tool for lowering the cost of cloud computing.
